For now it is a good idea to use comments in your code to keep track of what is happening where.<br /> Single line comments are always created with an ‘#’. Everything after that symbol in the line is not executed. Multi-line comments can be written by enclosing them in three ‘:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># first I create a single line comment, this is not executed
a = 5 # this line is executed, but the comment gets ignored
''' 
Now I write a multi-line comment
I can continue the comment on the next line

This makes code much, <strong>much</strong> harder to read and to use by other people or your own future self. It happens so often that people look back at what they wrote 3 weeks ago and do not understand half of it because they did not give descriptive names.</p> <p>You can also use comments to document your code a bit, but that always takes up extra space, often does not look good because you barely keep the same formatting throughout the code and gives the next user more work to do when trying to understand the code. Just making the code explain itself is the best solution of all.<br /> Here is a very simple example:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Bad code with abbreviations  
# it requires the user to interprete the variables and look at 
# used functions to understand what this even does
l = [1,5,12,17,18,14,11]
n = len(l)
s = sum(l)
m = s/n

# Fixing it with comments
# With comments we require the user to read all the extra text to 
# 1) understand what the data is
# 2) understand what is calculated

l = [1,5,12,17,18,14,11] # a list of temperature values
n = len(l)  # get total number of samples
s = sum(l)  # get total sum of samples
m = s/n     # calculate the mean value


# This gets so much easier to read when using declarative naming.
# You dont even have to look into the function to understand what it is doing:
monthly_temperature = [1,5,12,17,18,14,11]
number_of_samples = len(monthly_temperature) 
sum_of_samples = sum(monthly_temperature)
mean_monthly_temperature = sum_of_samples/number_of_samples 

# This does not mean that naming has to replace comments completely 
# (although some people argue like that). It is still alright to use comments
# to clarify parts of your code, just try keep it to a minimum and make the
# code as self-explanatory as possible!

Data Types and Variables </h2> <p>Python knows different types of data. A number is a different kind of variable than a word. That helps organizing the variables and defines, which operations are possible with which data. For example, computing the mean of a word would be difficult, just as translating a number to all-uppercase letters…</p> <p>In Python you dont have to define the data type yourself because Python is smart and finds the type of data on its own. For example when we define a number<br /> Python will understand and give it the type “int” or “float”, which means “integer” or “floating point number” (decimal) We will not cover all data types as we probably won’t need all of them for our purpose. However these ones are important:</p> <p><strong>Primitive Datatypes</strong><br /> Primitive datatypes are simple constructs that consists basically of one chunk of information, e.g. a number or a word:</p> <ul> <li><strong>int</strong>: Integer, a number without a floating point</li> <li><strong>float</strong>: Floating point number, a number with decimals</li> <li><strong>str</strong>: A string of characters, e.g. letters, words and sentences</li> <li><strong>bool</strong>: Boolean, a value that can only be True or False. This helps us make decisions in our code</li> </ul> <p><strong>Non-Primitive Datatypes</strong><br /> Non-primitive datatypes consist of aggregations of primitive datatypes. A list for example holds several numbers or words or something else</p> <ul> <li><strong>list</strong>: An ordered sequence of data, for example [1,2,3] is a list where each of the entries have a specific position and the entries can be accessed by indices</li> <li><strong>dict</strong>: A non-ordered mapping that consists of keys and values. That simply means, we can not get entries from the dictionary by indices (e.g. the 0th entry in a dictionary) but instead grab data from the dictionary by using the key. Imagine it like a digital telephone-book. The comparison does not hold completely because in theory a telephone book is ordered, but you would never search the 5001231th entry in a telephone book. Instead you would search the phone number of<br /> Mr. Smith”, so you go to the “key” Mr. Smith and get the “value” 0251/1234567.</li> </ul> <p>Lets look at some examples for data types:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Primitive datatypes:

letter_a = "a"                  # &lt;-- a string 
name = "Josefine" # &lt;-- a longer string 
age = 24                        # &lt;-- an integer
total_playtime = 354.5          # &lt;-- a float
is_injured = False              # &lt;-- a boolean

# Non-Primitive datatypes:
# list: 
# a list is alwasys enclosed by brackets 
# and the items are separeted with commas:
scores_last_games = [5,3,0,1] 
# To access the values we can use the index, for example 
scores_last_games[0]  # &lt;-- gets the first entry
scores_last_games[2]  # &lt;-- gets the 3rd entry
scores_last_games[-1] # &lt;-- gets the last entry
scores_last_games[-2] # &lt;-- gets the second last entry

# dictionary:
# is always enclosed by {}, 
# and has the structure "key":value, lines are separeted by a comma.
josefine = {
  "age":age,
  "total_playtime":total_playtime,
  "is_injured":is_injured,
  "scores_last_games":scores_last_games
}
# Now the values of the dictionary can be accessed using the key like this:
josefine["age"]
24
# new entries can be added by assigning a value to a new key:
josefine["trikot_number"] = 9
</code></pre><p>You can always find the type of a variable by using the type() function (more on functions later):</p><pre><code class="language-python">type(name)
type(age)
type(total_playtime)
type(is_injured)
type(scores_last_games)
type(josefine)
</code></pre><p>It is possible to change the type of a variable, but only if Python is able to understand what the outcome should be.<br /> The functions to do that have the same name as the target data type, for example int() or str():</p><pre><code class="language-python">int("10")       # &lt;-- this works
str(500)        # &lt;-- this works
float(500)      #&lt;-- this works
float("500.5")  #&lt;-- this works
float("abc")    #&lt;-- this won't work, how should you translate a word to a number?
</code></pre><p>One last thing is important to note. When you assign a non-primitive variable to another non-primitive variable, the two variables <strong>share</strong> the same data. That means, when you manipulate one you also manipulate the other. This can lead to confusion when you don’t keep it in mind.</p><pre><code class="language-python">list_1 = [1,2,3]  # a list is non-primitive
list_2 = list_1   # here we assign the non-primitive list_1 to the variable list_2
list_2.append(4)  # we add a fourth value, 4, to list_2
list_2            # list_2 is now [1,2,3,4]
list_1            # BUT! list_1 is now also [1,2,3,4]

# We can avoid this and extract the values from list_1 to create a completely new variable by using the .copy() function
list_1 = [1,2,3]
list_2 = list_1.copy()    # we copy the values of list_1 to the new variable list_2
list_2.append(4)          # we add a fourth value, 4, to the list list_2
list_2                    # list_2 is now [1,2,3,4]

</code></pre><p>On the other hand when you assign a variable containing a primitive datatype to another variable, the value gets simply copied to the new variable. Here is an example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">a = 5
b = a     # we assign the value of a to the variable b
b = b + 1 # we increase the value of b by one
b         # b is now 6
a         # a is still 5

For example you can add numbers and also add words to concatenate them, but you can not subtract words from each other…<br /> Here is a list of operations:</p><pre><code class="language-python">a = 5
b = 10
word1 = "Hi"
word2 = "there"

# Airthmetic Operators:
c = a + b   # adding numbers
concatenated_words = word1 + " " + word2 # adding words
d = b - c   # subtracting numbers
e = a * b   # multiplying numbers
f = b / 5   # dividing numbers
g = a ** 2  # Exponentation, this is a²
h = 12 % 5  # Modulus, this returns the remaining amount after fitting one number into the other as many times as possible.

Namely there are three: <strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong> and <strong>not</strong>. The use of these is pretty intuitive. If we combine two comparisons with an “and”, the result is only True if all conditions hold.<br /> If we combine two comparisons with an “or”, the result is True if one of the conditions hold, even if the other is False. Not is a special case, that reverts the result.</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Lets use a new example

is_peter_not_enrolled = not peter["is_enrolled"]

On the other side, the membership operator “in” checks whether an object is contained within another object. Simple examples:</p><pre><code class="language-python">a = [1,2,3] # a simple list
b = a       # we assign a to b, remember non-primitive data types?
a is b      # What will be the result of this?

1 in a      # we can test whether a contains a number 1

Conditionals and Loops </h1> <p>Conditionals and loops are constructs in your code that are often combined. A loop is used to do a certain task on many elements sequentially, a conditional uses a certain condition (or truth-evaluation) to decide whether a piece of code should be executed.</p> <h2 id="41-conditionals"> <a href="#41-conditionals" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="41-conditionals"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 4.1 Conditionals </h2> <p>Remember how we talked about comparison, logical and identitiy and membership operators? They all result in a boolean, stating whether a condition is True or False. We can make use of that by utilizing conditionals. Here is a simple example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">is_peter_smart = True
if is_peter_smart == True:
    print("Peter is smart")
</code></pre><p>Notice how indentation plays a role here! We end the line of the if-check with a “:” and start the new line indented. Indented lines signal a code block, that always belongs to the previous statement that ended with a “:”.</p> <p>In the above example the print() command will be executed because the value of is_peter_smart is True. If we check for a boolean value (True or False) we can also leave the comparison operation out and ask very coloquially:</p><pre><code class="language-python">is_peter_smart = True
if is_peter_smart:
    print("Peter is smart")
</code></pre><p>We can also define a code that should be executed, ONLY if the if-check is evaluated as False. For that we use the keyword “else”.</p><pre><code class="language-python">is_peter_smart = True
if is_peter_smart:
    print("Peter is smart")
else:
    print("Peter is not smart")
</code></pre><p>Finally, you can also chain if-checks by using the “elif” keyword. This stands for “else if”, meaning that “if the previous checks failed and this check is evaluated as True, run the code”</p><pre><code class="language-python">is_peter_smart = False
is_peter_big = True
if is_peter_smart:
    print("Peter is smart")
elif is_peter_big:
    print("Peter is big")
else:
    print("Peter is not smart and not big")

These two types are called “for-loops” and “while-loops”. They always consist of two parts: The definition how and over what you want to iterate (or “loop”) and the actual action you want to perform.</p> <h3 id="421-the-for-loop"> <a href="#421-the-for-loop" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="421-the-for-loop"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 4.2.1 The for-loop </h3> <p>The most “classical” loop is the for-loop.<br /> The syntax is, as often in Python, held very simple. Here is an easy example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">temperatures = [12,14,16,15,16,17,20,21]
for temperature in temperatures:
    print(temperature)
</code></pre><p>Notice that in the definition of the loop, we define a new variable called “temperature”. This variable represents the element we are currently working on in each step of the loop. So in the first step, temperature is 12, in the next temperature is 14 and so on.<br /> There is one very handy built-in method that can give you both the value of the list-entry <strong>and</strong> its corresponding index, called enumerate(). You can put them both in variables by using a comma in the loop-definition. A quick demo:</p><pre><code class="language-python">temperatures = [12,14,16,15,16,17,20,21]
hour_of_day = [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]

# When using enumerate, each iteration we get the index and value of the current list entry.
# So in the first loop index will be 0 and temperature 12, 
# next index will be 1 and temperature 14 and so on...
for index, temperature in enumerate(temperatures): 
    print("Temperature at "+str(hour_of_day[index]) + ":00: "+str(temperature) + "°C")

In the definition you define a condition and “while” that condition holds, the loop is executed.</p> <p>Look at this example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">a = 1

They are super useful, because often you want to do the same operation many times in your code but don’t want to write the same code every time again. Just write your own function and call it whenever you need its expertise! Lets just look at a simple example:</p><pre><code class="language-python"> def calculate_mean(list_of_values):
    n_samples = len(list_of_values)
    sum_of_values = sum(list_of_values)
    mean = sum_of_values/n_samples
    return mean
</code></pre><p>Pretty intuitive, right?</p> <p>A function is always defined by starting with the keyword “def”, then we give it a name, calculate_mean in this case. Afterwards in the braces are the “arguments” that the function takes. Arguments are pieces of information from the outside code, which the function requires to work. Here it is the list_of_values the function shall calculate the mean value of. After the “:” we follow with the indented codeblock that belongs to the function. Here we do all the operations the function should do. Finally, we use the “return” keyword which ends the function and defines, which piece of information should be returned to the outside code.</p> <p class="notice"><strong>Important</strong> The variables which are defined inside a function are restricted to that function! The outside code won’t know of the variables n_samples or “mean” which are defined in the function.</p> <p>Calling the function would for example look like this:</p><pre><code class="language-python">monthly_temperature = [4, 4, 7, 11, 15, 17, 28, 24, 27, 12, 7, 4]
mean_monthly_temperature = calculate_mean(monthly_temperature)
</code></pre><p>You do not <strong>have to</strong> return a value. You could also for example print something in the function and then return, without providing a value to return.</p> <p>In older versions of Python this was all there was to writing a function. However, nowadays you can add some additonal information to make it even easier for the next person or your future self to understand it. With some extra bits you can add the infos, what type of data you expect as an input to the function and what type of data it will output. This is generally a good thing to do and now considered best practice when writing functions. For the above code it would look like this:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def calculate_mean(list_of_values:list[float]) -&gt; int:
    n_samples = len(list_of_values)
    sum_of_values = sum(list_of_values)
    mean = sum_of_values/n_samples
    return mean
</code></pre><p>In the first line, after the list_of_values we write “:list[float]” to specify that we expect a list of float (floats actually imply integers, so we can use that to also accept integers). After the closing bracket we write<br /> “-&gt; int” which states that this function will return an integer value.</p> <div class="notice--primary"> <h3> <a href="#51-functions" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="51-functions"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Exercise 5.1.1 </h3> <p>As a first exercise, try to figure out what the output of the below function will be without executing it!</p><pre><code class="language-python">def square_value(value:int) -&gt; int:

A class basically represents a blueprint of an object that has certain properties. As an example, when I am working with data on ecosystems it could be convenient to have an ecosystem class that includes information about the ecosystem type, the location as latitude and longitude, and some meteorological data. Lets look at an example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">class Ecosystem():
    def __init__(self, id, IGBP_ecosystem_class, lat, lon, mean_annual_Tair, mean_annual_precip):
        self.id = id
        self.IGBP_ecosystem_class = IGBP_ecosystem_class
        self.lat = lat
        self.lon = lon
        self.mean_annual_Tair = mean_annual_Tair
        self.mean_annual_precip = mean_annual_precip
</code></pre><p>The definition of a class always begins with the class-keyword followed by the name of the class. It always has a first function called <strong>init</strong>() which is also called “constructor”. This method is used to create new instances of the class and assigns values to the class. The “self” keyword is in this context always used within a class to reference the class itself. Note, that “self” also has to be in the list of arguments for the function, but is does not get passed when you call the function.<br /> Many new words but stay with me, it is pretty simple when we look at an example, how we create a new instance:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># First we define the class
class Ecosystem():
    # see how the first argument here is "self"
    def __init__(self, id, IGBP_ecosystem_class, lat, lon, mean_annual_Tair, mean_annual_precip):
        self.id = id
        self.IGBP_ecosystem_class = IGBP_ecosystem_class
        self.lat = lat
        self.lon = lon
        self.mean_annual_Tair = mean_annual_Tair
        self.mean_annual_precip = mean_annual_precip

# now we use that class to create a new ecosystem-object, 
# see how we have to provide every value defined in the constructor except for "self":
amtsvenn = Ecosystem(id="amtsvenn", IGBP_ecosystem_class = "open shrublands", lat = 52.176, lon = 6.955, mean_annual_Tair = 10.5, mean_annual_precip = 870)

# Now you have stored all the info about amtsvenn in the "amtsvenn"
# object and can access them whenever you want:
print(amtsvenn.id)
print(amtsvenn.IGBP_ecosystem_class)
print(amtsvenn.lat)
print(amtsvenn.lon)
</code></pre><p>Classes can not only comprise of the information associated with them but can also have methods associated specifically with them. For example we can create a function that prints all the information enclosed in the object.</p><pre><code class="language-python">
class Ecosystem():
    def __init__(self, id, IGBP_ecosystem_class, lat, lon, mean_annual_Tair, mean_annual_precip):

# After creating the object we can use the classes functions like this:
amtsvenn.print_ecosystem_information()

Try to write a function called "Statistics". This class will be a "behavioural" class, meaning it does not need to hold own data but rather holds some methods, that belong to the same topic. In that class, define functions that calculate the mean, the variance and the standard deviation of a given list. Then use that class to calculate these metrics of an arbitrary list. </p> <p> Hint: For the standard deviation you need to take the square root. You can do that with pythons built-in math module. You can use it like this: </p><pre><code class="language-python">import math
math.sqrt(24)
</code></pre><p>Try to work out the solution yourself first! There is some starter code below, in case you get stuck though.</p> <details> <summary>Starter code</summary><pre><code class="language-python">class Statistics():

Most Python packages are written in object-oriented style, which (in very simple terms) means that the methods are enclosed in classes. So knowing the basics makes it much easier to understand the following bits.</p> </main> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
